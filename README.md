# C# Final Project Summer 2018
A basic application to store client information.
This project is based on the Model–view–viewmodel (MVVM) software architectural pattern.
The user interface (Assignment3Conv) has 3 view models; one for the Client tab, one for the address tab, and one for the company tab.
The project uses an ASP.NET web api (WebApi) for Create, read, update and delete (CRUD).
The project uses Entity framework 6 for data persistence (DataLayer).
